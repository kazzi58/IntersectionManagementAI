### Dependencies
    - MiniZinc
    - Python
    - pymzn library

### Description
    The IntersectionManagement.mzn file contains the model of the AI. The file takes in an array of old paths named "oldPaths" and an array with the old queue conditions named "WaitingQueue". As output, the model creates a new "paths" array and a "NewWaitingQueue" array. These two arrays are used for the next iteration.
    The python notebook doesn't work yet. To run the system, the model needs to be manually called repeatedly.
